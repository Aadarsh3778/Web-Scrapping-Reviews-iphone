      "Full Review: My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.\n",

      "Title: Not a great phone!\n",
      "Full Review: I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1. Display of date and time on status bar2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.4. Typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a OnePlus device.Overall, I am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though I must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered.\n",

      "Full Review: This is my first IPhonePhone looks and feels premium in hand, definitely you cannot compare with Chinese android phones.Battery is sufficient for normal day to day use, if you use hotspot then it will be drained in 5 hours, I don’t play games so can’t comment.Security, OS and hardware comprised intact kudos to apple for that, this is where iPhone stands out from other phones.Volume and camera is amazing and you feel next level if you are switching from Chinese smart phones. Same Dolby and oled display feels premium in iphone.Didn’t explore much on apple eco system, how ever I understood that you need to spend some extra bugs than usual if you want to be a premium user of apple eco system.Nothing comes for free here, in fact you would loose the freedom of being an android user (less customisation and no side loaders)In a good way, if you respect your privacy, security and getting premium services in the market you should choose iPhone.New users are good to go for iPhone 13 with few extra grands with the current offers, you will get extra features that are missing in 12.12 users forget about upgrading to 13 it will be a joke for you, it won’t worth it.\n",

My One Plus 9 Pro and Realme 7 shows 100% network bars and internet work fast enought to stream multiple HD videos at the same time (speed test result 45mbps - airtel postpaid). But this apple device shows only 1 bar and sometimes none. You can't do anything other than just looking at phone. I kept 9 pro and iphone 13 at the same place at the same time having airtel postpaid sim card inserted. OnePlus gets full coverage of same network while iPhone gets only 1 bar coverage which cannot be used for anything. When I checked online, found that a lot of people facing same network issue with iPhone 13 series. Seriously, I would not recommend anyone to buy this brick.\n",

      "Full Review: Though we talk a lot about high price for iPhones, this is worth the amount. Smooth touch, perfect to hold in hand. For the screen size of 6.1\", it looks small overall. I could have gone for pro max but more than 1.5L budget is way too much for me :-)* Good battery back-up (With low battery mode always on, 5 hours of talk-time, around 2 hours of twitter and 2 hours of whatsapp usage, 1 hour of songs listening, 1 hour of rummy/candy crush games and notification of all these items, the battery comes for more than 24 hours for me)* Getting charged quickly from 20% to 100% within 2 hours* Perfect camera and I love that 'Live' photo option* Body design is awesome. When I held it in my hand for the first time, felt really happy about the design and the size of the iPhone 13.\n",

Entire set-up took just 10-15 mins and everything was copied over w/o any loss of data. Face ID set-up is very powerful. Battery life could be still better. Obviously price point could be a little more affordable.\n",

      "Full Review: you really don't need to upgrade if you bought a new iPhone last year. But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark — all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.\n",

I am a moderate user when it comes to cellphones i.e the basic Instagram Facebook WhatsApp YouTube and Netflix. This phone if charged fully lasts up to 24 hours if used moderately without any heavy gaming.The reason I am writing this review is because of the useless comments of people that are rated high but can’t actually afford this phone.Coming from one plus 6t this phone is a huge jump (I love my one plus… still using it as my work phone) but it is obviously a lot to adjust to since we are completely switching to a different OS seems like shifting to a different nation all together.Anyway.. if you do have a good enough budget you should definitely go for this beauty\n",

      "Full Review: Was using 11 before this. Wanted to go for 13 pro. Wished 120 hertz pro motion display in my phone. But that costed way too much. Nevertheless this standard 13 model is not too behind. Almost same cameras. Amazing battery life and speakers. And build is similar to 12 offourse but functionality is better. Great changes from 12 especially in camera and battery. Perfect value smartphone in 72000₹ (128gb). IOS is IOS. Ecosystem is unmatched. Hence for me a perfect phone.\n",

      "Full Review: The biggest improvement I have noted is the battery life. It’s really good. Upgraded from my 7 plus after 4.6 years. Another thing I like is MagSafe charging. One of the main issue I face with my old phone was charging port failure due to dust accumulation. MagSafe charge helps from above said issue. Of course we have to pay for that extra. Even though am enjoying bigger battery ,the thickness increased a bit and it is bit annoying. My advice is it’s a highly paid model, so use it minimum 3 years.\n",

Absolutely love the camera, battery backup, the build quality-just no words there. Unlike android, I do not have to worry for extended zoom and g calls--very reliable. Definitely, Apple got another long time iPhone customer.\n",

(Additional Rs. 1900 for apple charger). The cable is type c to lightning. (Additional Rs. 1000 for certified belkin usb to lightning cable; apple cable >2000). No headphones. (additional Rs. 2000 for other brand earbuds). No cover and screen guard. So for this price you will get phone, cable, sim ejector pin. Im not satisfied with this cable, they should have provided usb to lightning cable.\n",
